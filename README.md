The University Management System is a comprehensive web application built using the Spring Framework designed to manage various aspects of a university's administrative and academic operations. It facilitates the management of students, instructors, courses, and grading systems, as well as planning and assigning responsibilities for instructors and students. The system also includes validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity.


1. User Registration
Students and instructors can register their accounts in the system.
User profiles store essential information such as name, contact details, and roles (Student/Instructor).

3. Course Planning
Facilitates the creation and management of courses.
Instructors can plan and schedule courses, assigning topics, dates, and other relevant details.

5. Grading System
A comprehensive grading mechanism allows instructors to assign grades to students.
Different types of grading scales (numeric, letter grades) can be used based on the course requirements.

7. Course Assignments
Instructors are assigned to courses.
Students can be enrolled in different courses based on their study programs.

9. Instructor-Student Assignments
Instructors are assigned to individual students or groups of students for mentorship or class instruction.

10. Validation System
The application includes built-in validation to ensure that only valid data is entered.
The system validates student grades, course schedules, and user registration details.
